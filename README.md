# What is Blocitoff?

Blocitoff is a todo list web application that automatically expires todo items after 7 days to help prevent clutter. The concept is based around the fact that if a todo item dosen't get completed within 7 days, then it's not of importance and no longer needs to be on a todo list. Users can create and delete todo items. Items will automatically expire after 7 days of creation via a rake automated task. 

I created Blocitoff as part of the [Bloc](bloc.io) full-stack web developer curriculum. I was given very little instruction for this project, but rather was given a list of user stories to accomplish.

# User Stories

| User Story    |
| ------------- |
| As a user, I want to sign up for a free account by providing a user name, password and email |
| As a user, I want to sign in and out of Blocitoff |
| As a user, I want to see my profile page |
| As a user, I want to create multiple to-do items |
| As a developer, I want to seed the development database automatically with users and to-do items |
| As a user, I want to mark to-do items as complete and have them deleted |
| As a user, I want to see how old a to-do item is |
| As a user, my to-dos should be automatically deleted seven days after their creation date |
