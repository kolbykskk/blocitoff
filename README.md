# What is Markitoff?

Markitoff is a to-do list web application that automatically expires to-do items after 7 days to help prevent clutter. The concept is based around the fact that if a to-do item dosen't get completed within 7 days, then it's not of importance and no longer needs to be on a to-do list. Users can create and delete to-do items. Items will automatically expire after 7 days of creation via a rake automated task.
